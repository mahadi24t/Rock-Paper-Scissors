# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game 🎮

Welcome to the **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game! This is a fun little project that lets you challenge the computer to see who’s the ultimate champion. It’s simple, interactive, and perfect for quick entertainment.

## What’s This Game About? 🤔
You know the drill: pick your move—**Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**—and let the computer pick one too. The winner of each round is decided based on the classic rules:

- **Rock beats Scissors** 🪨✂️
- **Paper beats Rock** 📄🪨
- **Scissors beat Paper** ✂️📄

It’s a best-of-5 game, so whoever wins the most rounds out of 5 is crowned the champion. Think you’ve got what it takes? Let’s play!

## How to Play 🕹️
1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser. 
2. Click on your move: **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**.
3. Watch as the game tells you who won the round.
4. Keep an eye on the scoreboard to see the scores and the number of rounds played.
5. After 5 rounds, the game will announce the final winner.
6. Want to play again? Just hit the **Reset Game** button to restart.

## What Makes This Game Cool? 🌟
- **Fun & Interactive**: The game responds to your clicks, shows results instantly, and keeps track of scores.
- **Clean Design**: It’s easy on the eyes with a modern, playful look.
- **Casual Challenge**: A quick 5-round match is perfect for killing a few minutes.

## Behind the Scenes 🔧
Here’s how it all works:
- The computer’s move is picked randomly every round.
- The `playRound` function decides the winner of each round and updates the scores.
- The scoreboard dynamically updates with each round.
- After 5 rounds, the game declares the winner (or a tie!) and prompts you to restart if you want to play again.

- **HTML**: Builds the structure of the game (buttons, results, scoreboard).
- **CSS**: Makes everything look great with colors, hover effects, and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Powers the game logic—like determining the winner, updating scores, and managing rounds.
